#Functions Homework

## 1.Echo

	Write a function that takes in a string and prints its echo - repeat the last two characters 3 times. For example, if you enter "HELLO" it would print out "HELLOLOLOLO". 

## 2. Has an L

	My least favorite letter is l. I hate the fact that I had to use it twice in the previous sentence. I hate it so much that I want you to write a function that can determine if there is a 'l'l —lower or upper case— inside of it. Return true if there is an l, false if there isn't.
