## Tutorialspoint Java explanations:
- Visit the link here and do the "Java Tutorial" and "Java Object Oriented" sections you see on the left hand side.


## Java Tutorial:
For this section, cover everything you can to get more information about the fundamentals. If we covered it in class, you should re-enforce it again via the tutorials.

* Don't worry too much about the following sections but do explore them if you have time:
- Files & I/O
- Regular Expressions
- Date and Time

3) Practice Syntax!
- It is very important for you to know syntax by heart. There is no logic to it besides memorizing when and where we use brackets, parentheses, colons, semi-colons, etc. Java is a language just like English is (which tells us when/where to put comas, periods, etc).

My suggestion is to do the following exercises inside IntelliJ IDE:
- Write 25 for loops that iterate over an int
- Write 25 for loops that iterate over a double
- Write 25 for loops that iterate over a String
- Write 25 for loops that iterate over a float
- Bonus: Write above enhanced versions of above for loops ( using "for-each" notation )
- Write 25 while loops that iterate over an int
- Write 25 while loops that iterate over a double
- Write 25 while loops that iterate over a String
- Write 25 while loops that iterate over a float
- Write 25 do-while loops that iterate over an int
- Write 25 do-while loops that iterate over a double
- Write 25 do-while loops that iterate over a String
- Write 25 do-while loops that iterate over a float
- Write 25 switch statements that switch on an int
- Write 25 switch statements that switch on a String
- Write 25 switch statements that switch on a double
- Write 25 switch statements that switch on a float
- Write 15 functions return void and have no arguments
- Write 15 functions that return int and have no arguments
- Write 15 functions that return double and have no arguments
- Write 15 functions that return float and have no arguments
- Write 15 functions that return String and have no arguments
- Write 15 functions that return void and have 1 argument
- Write 15 functions that return int and have 2 arguments
- Write 15 functions that return String and have 3 arguments
