## Introduction

In this lab, you will be creating your very own *Tree* class. **Note**: it has to be a general tree structure, **not** a *Binary Tree*.
Then you will modify the BFS algorithm you wrote to work on generic tree structures with 0 or more leaf nodes.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

This lab will be split up into two sections: the practice and the interview sections.


#### Deliverable
